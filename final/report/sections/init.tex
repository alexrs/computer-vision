\section{Initialization}

\subsection{Manual}
As suggested in the project statement, manual initialization
was implemented first to evaluate the fitting algorithm and
the automatic initialization separately.

The implementation is pretty straightforward. Using different
OpenCV routines, the mean shape can be dragged to its initial
position, and one it has been located, the fitting algorithm starts.

Nevertheless, this procedure presents a problem. The rotation of the
shape can't be changed, which causes that the initial estimation is not
as accurate as it could be.

\subsection{Automatic}
