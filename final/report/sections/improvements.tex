\section{Future Improvements}

\subsection{Multi-resolution Active Shape Model}
To improve the efficiency and robustness of the detection, a
multi-resolution model can be used.

At the base of the pyramid it is the original image and
the level is the lowest (level 0). The image in the higher
level is formed by subsampling the former image then we obtain
a lower resolution version of the image with half number of
the pixels along each dimension. Subsequent levels are
obtained by further subsampling.

With this method, the initial fit of the model to approximate
will vary faster in position and orientation, and this fit will be
improved and refinated in each level of the pyramid.

\subsection{Width of Search Profile}
In the implemented algorithm, search profile is only
along a single line when searching forthe suggested
movements of landmarks. But this search technique could
be affected by noise in the image. To avoid this problem,
the search space could be expanded adding some width to it. 

\subsection{Landmarks Grouping}
As we have seen new allowed shapes should comply with
the constraint that the range of $b$ must be in the inverval
$-3\sqrt\lambda \leq b \leq 3\sqrt\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the
eigenvalue result of the principal component analysis. But some of
the shape variation isnt decided by a single principal component, and
unexpected shapes could still apear even with the range of $b$ limited.
This problem can be avoided grouping ladmarks that tend to move together.
