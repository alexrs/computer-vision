\section{Fit the model}

The algorithm used can be found in the paper of Cootes et al.
\textit{An introduction to Active Shape Models}.

Starting with the initial estimate computed previously as $X_i$
\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Examine a region of the image around each point $X_i$
    to find the best nearby match for the point ${X_i}'$
  \item Update the parameters ($X_t, Y_t, s, \theta, b$) to best
    fit the new found points $X$.
  \item Apply constraint to the parameters to ensure
    plausible shapes.
  \item Repeat until convergence.
 \end{enumerate}
