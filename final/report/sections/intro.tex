\section{Introduction}
Detecting objects in images manually is a tedious process and
error prone if performed by a human. Images are inherently noisy, and
sometimes indentifying the object we are looking for is not an easy duty.
An automatic method to indentify and segmentate objects in images
is then needed.

In this project, a model-based segmentation approach has been
implemented based on Active Shape Models, developed by Cootes et al.
